== About Me
I am a Researcher at Adobe Research India in Bangalore, working in the areas of Causal Inference and Machine Learning. Previously, I was a Data and Applied Scientist in the Ranking Allocation and Pricing Team in Bing Ads, Sunnyvale, CA. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA in 2016, where I was advised by Prof. Eric Rains. Prior to that, I received an Integrated Master's in Mathematics and Scientific Computing at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur in 2011.

== Next bit, next heading level two
=== Getting into level three now

Why not use a list
- to explain the way you do lists?
- to demonstrate how a line\n break might work?

Or perhaps a
. Multilevel
  .. Numbered list
  .. Is more
. Useful?

: {Definition} lists, especially when there are many definitions
: {Can be useful} for explaining things


== Finally, a few more blocks
This `section' features "smart quotes".

~~~
{Simple block}
This is a simple text block, with a title. Notice how the previous line has only one set of braces (\{\}).
~~~

	
~~~
{Interactive Python listing}{pyint}
>>> print 'Interactive Python code.'
'Interactive Python code.'
~~~

	
~~~
{}{}
Plain code block with no title.

You might need 2--3 different-sized dashes---they can be useful. Now we're done!
